Script for scraping people also ask questions. The script is designed to remove the urls from the answers scraped. The script doesnot use proxies and google blocks the script. I have added a method to runs script till the IP is blocked by google. The default questions are set to 15. Increasing this number will cause the script to stop due to google detecting large requests. Number of questions can be changed from line 33. If you want to add proxies then you have to change few lines in the module used
